# score_analyser
This is a basic data analysis tool that takes a file path on the user's machine and a pass threshold as an input. The file should contain a comma-separated list of numeric scores, each between zero and 100. This program internally converts each score to a letter grade using a common US percentage scale to categorise the scores. The program also outputs rudimentary statistics, such as the average score, the maximum, the minimum, and the number of passing grades. Invalid inputs are handled, including the provided file path not existing, the pass threshold not being between zero and 100, a score not being (a number) between 0 and 100, and the absence of scores.
